    <hr>
    <p>Dedicated and diligent Professional Accountant with 6 years of experience in the field of tax and accounting. I'm
        an expert in
        accounting, payroll, taxes, and financial planning. I graduated from Hailey College of Commerce at the
        University of Punjab
        with a Master of Commerce focused on finance. <br>
        <br>
        Initially, I started working as Accounting Intern and worked for almost two years then I worked for the steel
        sector for two
        years as an accountant before moving on to a pharmaceutical firm for an internship after earning my master's. In
        order to
        maintain accurate records of salaries and tax withholdings, I have assisted my customers in designing and
        implementing
        payroll systems. Right now, I am employed by the Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board in Lahore as an
        accountant.<br>
        <br>
        Along with using accounting programs like Quickbooks and ERP, I am proficient in using FBR to prepare tax
        returns and
        contributing personal qualities like commitment, goal-setting, creativity, and the capacity for action. <br>
        <br>
        Willing and excited to make a positive contribution to the success of the team via diligence, care for the
        little things, and
        superior planning skills. Determined to improve professionally and learn new things.
